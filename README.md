# AetherealEcho
ESP32-based WFi and ping monitor embedded in vintage millivolt meter.
The purpose of this build was to utilize nearly 100 years old wooden box with a great looking meter.

## Main Functions

### Wi-Fi Connection and Network Configuration
- The Aethereal Echo, powered by an ESP32, attempts to connect to a local Wi-Fi network upon startup.
- If the device fails to connect to the configured Wi-Fi network, it activates an Access Point (AP) with a captive portal. The AP's SSID is broadcast as "aethereal-echo".
- Users can connect to this Wi-Fi network and navigate to the IP address 192.168.4.1 using a web browser.
- A configuration page is presented allowing users to enter the local Wi-Fi network's name (SSID) and password. Upon submission, the ESP32 will reboot and attempt to connect to the specified Wi-Fi network.

### Pinging Predefined Servers
- Aethereal Echo periodically pings a configurable server, with the interval between pings defined in the settings.â—¦
- If a ping is successful, the meter's needle displays the ping time on its scale, and a short ping sound is played as confirmation.
- If a ping times out, the meter indicates an "Echo Timeout" by moving to 1000 mTicks (maximum scale position).
- After several consecutive failed pings, Aethereal Echo initiates an alert, which includes sound and alternating red and blue flashing LEDs.
- Following an alert, the device automatically switches to the next configured ping server and reboots.

### Wi-Fi Access Monitoring
- After a successful initial connection to a Wi-Fi network, the Aethereal Echo continuously monitors its connection status.
- If the Wi-Fi connection is lost, Aethereal Echo starts an alert with a sound and alternating red and blue flashing LEDs.
- The device will then attempt to reconnect to the WiFi network or reboot

### Pinging predefined servers
- The aethereal_echo pings one of the predefined servers.
- If ping is successful, the meter displays the value of the response in milliseconds up to 1000 on the logarithmic scale and the sound of 'ping' is played by the buzzer.
- If ping times out, the meter shows 1000 (Ping Timeout) and a sad sound is played.
- After several time outs, aethereal_echo switches to another server and reboots.
